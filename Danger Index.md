#info 

A system of communicating the threat posed by an element of the Tanglements, created by the [[Cartographers Guild]].

### Instance & Region Danger Index
An index to describe the danger posed by entire instances, or regions/locations within instances. Indexes can be suffixed to indicate specific factors as follows: "-u" for units, "-f" for flora, "-e" for environment or terrain. These suffixes can be compounded - and should be done so in the order just listed. If no suffix is given, it is assumed that the index communicates a general threat posed by all factors.

- 0 - Safe to traverse; no danger posed by any factors.
- 1 - Minor danger; be wary during travels, low risk of death.
- 2 - Medium danger; risk of death if not wary during travels.
- 3 - High danger. Remain conscious of surroundings at all times, high risk of death otherwise.
- 4 - Very high danger; risk of death imminent at all times.
- 5 - Extreme danger; almost guaranteed fatal.
