Butterflies are [[Tanglements Theory#Units & Flora|Low Level Unit]] found in all Instances.

## Description

Butterflies are theorised to be directly imported from the real world and do not possess any inherent physical changes. Their transfer to the Tanglements however has given them many simulation manipulation abilities. Powder from their wings has also been shown to quickly heal any wound, work as an antidote to poisons and venoms, cure any disease, and in rare cases even resurrect the recently deceased. It is theorised that should a large enough amount of this dust be collected, any human resurrection may be possible.

### Behaviour

In contrast to the [[Snail|Snails]], it appears Butterflies take priority in preventing harm to Humans. In dire enough situations, they will provide the dust from their wings to aid. This is only done in extreme cases, as it temporarily disables their abilities.

Great care should be taken around Butterflies, as harming them will cause a plethora of temporary instabilities in the Instance that it was harmed, and any connected Instances. The person who harmed the Butterfly will also become a [[Butterfly Zombie]].

Butterflies have also been shown to remember people who make attempts to protect them.
