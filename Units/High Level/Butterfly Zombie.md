Butterfly Zombies are [[Tanglements Theory#Units & Flora|High Level Unit]], that are created when a Human harms a [[Butterfly]]

## Description
Ape-like with two large insectoid wings. Covered in a sharp patterned fur that transitions to be hedgehog spine-like down the spine of the Unit.

### Behaviour
Butterfly Zombies are extremely aggressive and will attack anything on sight. They are fast and agile, yet seem to be greatly visually impared and lacking in spatial awareness. They are also prone to Perception Instability and will often be subject to spontaenous Perception Transfer during times of high activity such as combat or pursuit.

They also often become pawns to Snails or other [[Tanglements Theory#Units & Flora|Low Level Units]] that will control Butterfly Zombies for their own purposes.
