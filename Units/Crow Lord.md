Crow Lords are a [[Tanglements Theory#Units & Flora|Low Level Unit]], found in several Instances and originating from [[Beta-1]]

## Description

Crow Lords are generally observed to be humanoids wearing a gas mask, and various forms of 19th century naval officer garments. They are always surrounded by flocks of Crows, a Sub-Unit of the Crow Lord created through their simulation manipulatory powers.

### Behaviour
[[Precursors|Precursor]] texts have talked of Crow Lords as one of the few Units that appear to possess an obvious sentience with language and culture. More recent observations contradict this however, and some believe the Crow Lords have lost their sentience in the time between the [[Precursors|Precursor]] and the modern Tanglements. They are largely aggressive, using their Crow Sub-Units to hunt down and kill prey. They have also been shown however to possess a large capacity for curiosity, particularly in Human experimentation.
