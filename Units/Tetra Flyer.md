The Tetra Flyer is a [[Tanglements Theory#Units & Flora|High Level Unit]] native to, and originating from the [[Alpha-1]] Instance.

## Description
Tetra Flyers are humanoid avians. Their distinct feature is a set of four large wings, notably similar in shape to that of a crow yet matte grey in appearance and lacking any colourful sheen. They typically stand at 5ft or below, and often have greatly underdeveloped legs. Their faces are mostly human, however they possess no mouth and no lower jaw, with three large fangs protruding from underneath the upper jaw. Despite the lack of a mouth, they possess sonic organs below the ears that can produce a variety of sounds.

### Behaviour
The Tetra Flyer is greatly territorial. They inhabit the upper regions of [[Alpha-1]] architecture and often swarm around particularly high spires. They remain entirely passive and will only attack in defence of their territory, or when provoked.
