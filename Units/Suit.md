Suits are a [[Tanglements Theory#Units & Flora|Mid Level Unit]] native to the [[Alpha-1]] Instance, and of unknown origin.

## Description
Suits are elusive Unit that appear to be sentient manifestations of various formal wear. Occasionally they can be seen with hats, or items such as umbrellas. They have never been observed to have a physical body, and when seemingly 'killed' they fall to the floor as a pile of clothes that disintegrates within a few hours.

### Behaviour
Suits have often been described as the 'faeries' of the Tanglements, a comparison first observed in a [[Precursors|Precursor]] text. They will often appear to lone travellers or people who have recently been transported to the Tanglements and will either guide them to a safer location (sometimes through inducing an Instance Hop) or will present them with something of use.

This however is a generalisation, and the behaviour of Suits can vary greatly. Different variations of Suits will take vastly different approaches to humans and other Units or Flora.

### Identified Variations
- Common Suit - Black or Grey garments, observant or helpful.
- White Suit - White garments, sometimes with red, blue, or black stripes. Purely observant.
- Red Dress - Ranging from a vibrant pink to deep crimson in colour, with darker colours often helpful and light colours more malicient in nature.
- Blue Suit / Blue Dress - Purely helpful, have been observed to be immune to all known forms of harm, however Blue Suit remains have formerly been found.
- Yellow Suit - Will chase down a target and perform a forced Instance Hop on them.
