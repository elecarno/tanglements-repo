*Reality is a simulation, and its creators are dead.*

This is the conclusion many of the adventurers of the Tanglements have come to. In these forgotten sections of reality, the code of the simulation attempts to outcast any errors in its workings, maintaining the illusion of a stable existence. With the apparent death of the creators however, people have begun to find themselves glitched into the Tanglements.

The Tanglements is a multi-layered group of dimensions in which perception is your enemy and everything is unpredictable. See [[Tanglements Theory]] for more info.
