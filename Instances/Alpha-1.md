#instance 

The first Instance in the **[[Tanglements Theory#Alpha Branch (Î±)|Alpha Branch]]**. Common nicknames include: "The Alphaways", "The City", and "The Streets".

> Danger: Safe - Deadly (Dependant on location)

## Description
**Alpha-1** is best described as a post-apocalyptic cityscape. It constists mostly of dense streets and alleyways, it is presumed to be infinite and has been entirely observed as euclidean in nature. There are however, many barriers that have prevented the greater exploration of the Instance (listed later in the article). [[Tanglements Theory|Time Overlap]] have also been widely observed different sections of the city having originated from different points in time.

## Inhabitance
### Units
The Instance has been observed to host a variety of Units, however they are most often found clustered in particular sections of the Instance. Thus it is most common for one to find themselves largely alone within the Instance.

#### Native
- [[Tetra Flyer]]
- [[Shapeshifting Cat]]

#### Invasive
- [[Suit]]

#### General/Other Observed
- [[Butterfly]]
- [[Butterfly Zombie]]
- [[Crow Lord]]

### Flora
In contrast to the animate Units, the inanimate Units of the **Alpha-1** are found almost everywhere in the Instance and are generally a more prominent threat. The observed Flora include:

- Calling Vines
- Street Trees
- Yellow Glow Bulb
- Iron Berries
- Potassium Berries

### Groups
Being the first inhabited Instance, **Alpha-1** found itself to be the initial home of many early human settlements. With the discovery of **Alpha-2** however, the majority of these were quickly abandoned. The current active groups in the Instance are:

- Integrationist Church
