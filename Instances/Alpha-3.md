#instance 

The third Instance in the **[[Tanglements Theory#Alpha Branch (Î±)|Alpha Branch]]**. Common nicknames include: "The Jungle"

> Danger: Extremely Dangerous

## Description
**Alpha-3** is a jungle-like environment comprised of giant trees called Hyper Trees (named for their 4-dimensional properties), sitting a top an ocean. The Instance is inhabited by [[Alterations|altered]] and unaltered versions of the mega-fauna that was believed to inhabit the Earth several hundred million years ago.

Traversal of the Instance is treacherous, with the constant threat from Units and the difficult climbing necessary to cross the large branches that span the upper environment of **Alpha-3**. Presumed death from falling into the waters below is extremely common.

The ocean of **Alpha-3** has been theorised to connect with the ocean of **[[Gamma-1]]**, however no solid evidence of this has yet been attained.

There is no evidence in favour of **Alpha-3** being infinite, nor is there any contradicting evidence of it being finite. The Instance remains largely unexplored.

## Inhabitance

### Units
**Alpha-3** is home to some of the most documented native Units of any of the [[Tanglements Theory#Known Tanglements|Known Tanglements]], however this is often due to the unusually aggressive nature of the Units allowing themselves to be discovered. Some in the Tanglements theorise that all Instances have, in actuality, a similar diversity of Units.

#### Native

- [[Giant Arthropleura]]
- [[Colossal Meganeura]]
- [[Titanoboa]]
- [[Giga Mantis]]
- [[Queen Mantis]]
- [[Giant Hornet]]

#### General / Other Observed

- [[Snails]]

### Flora
The Instance is also home to a large diversity of inanimate Units, with the general quirk of **Alpha-3** plant life being an initially unseen 4-dimensional geometry. Plants or structures in this Instance are prone to changing geometry throughout the day, or even suddenly and without warning; they are not however, non-euclidean.
