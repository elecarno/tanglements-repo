## Description

**Gamma-1** is a small island that hosts an run-down nuclear power plant, surrounded by a mist covered ocean under a constant night sky. The ocean is theorised to be on the other side of the **Alpha-3** ocean. The nuclear-power plant's interior is non-euclidean and infinite in nature. Up to seven reactor rooms and their accompanying facilities have been discovered so far, each from a different time period.
