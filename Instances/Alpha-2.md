#instance 

The second Instance in the **[[Tanglements Theory#Alpha Branch (α)|Alpha Branch]]**. Common nicknames include: "The Forest", and "The Home Instance"

> **Danger Index: 0**

## Description
**Alpha-2** is an infinite highlands terrain with blue tinted plant life and a constantly pitch black sky. Large freshwater lakes can also be found scattered between the hills. Crowds of Mindless Mimics wander the Instance, and are commonly seen travelling between lakes; with following them to acquire water being a technique used by many human travellers in the Instance.

A faint blue glow covers much of the land, provided by the Glow Flora native to the Instance. The sky is the only possible danger in the instance, as it induces hallucinatory effects when looked at directly for prolonged periods of time.

Glow Trees grow in large forests, and provide timber that is used to construct large settlements or burned for heat as the Instance has an ambient temperature of around 18°C. Clay from the lakes has also been used for the purpose of construction.

## Inhabitance
The only Unit consistently observed in the Tanglements is the [[Mindless Mimic]]

### Flora
The inanimate units of **Alpha-2** are all relatively similiar, with a blue tint and some form of bioluminescence. Notably, none are edible.

- [[Glow Trees]]
- [[Glow Bulbs]]
- [[Glow Weeds]]

### Groups
An absolute majority of the human population of the Tanglements have constructed their primary settlements in **Alpha-2**. Most of these settlements are largely undocumented or poorly documented, however the major factions inhabiting the Instance are:

- [[Settlers Union]]
- [[Travellers Cooperative]]
- [[Cartographers Guild]]
