#instance 

The first Instance in the **[[Tanglements Theory#Gamma Branch (Î³)|Gamma Branch]]**. Common nicknames include: "The Library"

> **Danger Index: 2ue**

## Description

A finite non-euclidean library with rooms that change in a cycle that mirrors **[[Gamma-3]]**. The library is warm and brightly lit by sunlight from large windows that glow a pure white. There are also lower levels to the library that are candle lit. The books contained within the library are on a range of topics, are found in various languages, and are from different points in history. Some of the books however, are largely related to the Tanglements and have become a valuable resource. Several [[Precursors|Precursor]] texts have also been discovered in the library, particularly in difficult to reach spaces.
