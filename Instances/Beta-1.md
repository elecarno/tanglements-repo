#instance 

The first Instance in the **[[Tanglements Theory#Beta Branch (Î²)|Beta Branch]]**. Common nicknames include: "The Battlefield", and "The Scrap"

> Danger: Deadly

## Description

Instance **Beta-1** is a large [[Tanglements Theory|Time Overlap]] in which different battles from across history have merged together into one landscape. The [[Tanglements Theory|Temporal Shadow]] of the soldiers, civilians, and any other people involved in the battles can be seen; however bullets, explosives, shells, and any other ordinance that were used in the battles transfer over in full physical state. The same applies to vehicles such as tanks. This makes the instance generally extremely dangerous to cross, however it is also an invaluable source of various weapons and technology, with the quieter sections of the Instance (temporary ceasefires, or in some cases anomalous areas where there is only the "frozen in time" aftermath of a battle) continually scavenged for resources.

The transitions between the terrain of different battles or points in time are generally jarring, with cutoff mountains becoming unnatural cliffs that suddenly give way to lowlands or oceans. Theoretically, the instance is finite, as there is not an infinite number of battles to construct it; however a cutoff point has not yet been discovered.
