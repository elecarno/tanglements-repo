The Tanglements is believed to be based on the failings of the code of reality. The two key aspects of the Tanglements are Instances, and Perception Transfer.

## Instances
The Tanglements is constructed from a group of dimensions that are believed to occupy the same co-ordinate space, and are layered on top of / within each other. The Known Tanglements consists of 11 instances. There is also the Theorised Tanglements, which is comprised of Instances that have been read about in [[Precursors|Precursor]] texts, or are of a reocurring nature in anecdotes.

Instances exist in "branches" in which Perception Transfer occurs, Instances are named based on these branches however they do not affect travel between instances, which is based on a seperate series of connections known as the Hop Network. Branches are named using Greek letters, with the Instances as suffix numbers.

Shown below is a map of the known Tanglements, the instance branches, and the travelable connections of the Hop Network (in grey).

### The Hop Network
The series of connections between instances that can be traveled using various methods, most commonly Hop Pills or Entanglement Batteries.

### Known Tanglements

#### Alpha Branch (α)
The Alpha Branch was allegedly the first that humans had entered. This theory is often disputed however, as it is also the only known branch to contain relatively livable instances, these being α-1 and α-2.

This branch contains three known instances:

 -  [[Alpha-1|α-1]] "The Alphaways"
 -  [[Αlpha-2|α-2]] "The Forest"
 -  [[Αlpha-3|α-3]] "The Jungle"

#### Beta Branch (β)
The Beta Branch was (on record) the second branch to be discovered by human explorers. Instances in this branch are known to be prone to Time Overlaps.

This branch contains two known instances:

 -  [[Beta-1|β-1]] "The Battlefield"
 -  [[Beta-2|β-2]] "The Kitchen"

#### Gamma Branch (γ)
Despite bearing the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, the Gamma Branch was the fourth to be discovered by human explorers. The use of the γ was withheld after the discovery of a [[Precursors|Precursor]] text which told of the dangerous Gamma Branch. The Instances of this Branch are notorious for their high levels of gamma radiation, with the activity of the nearby environment of any given person within a 10m radius increasing at roughly 2 kBq/h.

This branch contains three known instances:

 -  [[Gamma-1|γ-1]] "The Reactor"
 -  [[Gamma-2|γ-2]] "The Library"
 -  [[Gamma-3|γ-3]] "The Sewer"

#### Delta Branch (Δ)
With the γ reserved, the next letter of the Greek alphabet was chosen as the name for the third discovered branch. This branch contains the incredibly important instance Δ-1, otherwise known as "The Lab", which is crucial to the survival of any and all human factions in the Tanglements as it contains the equipment necessary to turn [[Chuppy|Chuppy Blood]] into [[Perception Pills]].

This branch contains two known instances:

 -  [[Delta-1|Δ-1]] "The Lab"
 -  [[Delta-2|Δ-2]] "The Space"

#### Pi Branch (π)
This branch contains only 1 known instance, that being π-1, "The Hub". This branch has not yet been discovered to be attached to the Hop Network and has only been accessed by accident or through extraordinary circumstances, such as with the aid of a [[Snail]] or [[Butterfly]] . Once accessed, π-1 is known to have the capability to allow transport to any other instance.

### Theorised Tanglements

#### π-2 "The Escape" 
With the accepted existence of π-1 as a hub that binds all instances, some have theorised that there is a π-2 that binds the Tanglements and the "real" universe.

## Perception Transfer
An effect which defines many aspects of the Tanglements. Perception Transfer is the ability for the different perceivable aspects of an entity or object to be split between the instances within a branch. It is commonly applied and thought of based on the sensory organs (taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing), however can also deal in other senses such as proprioception.

Perception Transfer may be voluntary or involuntary depending on the affected individual or object. In most cases regarding humans, it is involuntary. There are many native Units of the Tanglements however that have the capability to perform and control Perception Transfer at will.

### Perception Sickness
An aspect of Perception Transfer which applies only to humans. Manifesting as a gradual splitting of one's senses, then body parts / organs, and finally conscience, across the instances of a branch.

The common stages of perception sickness are as follows:

 -  scattering of taste and smell
 -  scattering of touch, hearing, and sight
 -  scattering of all 5 senses across different limbs
 -  scattering of the limbs themselves and loss of sense of self
 -  slow scattering of entire body until you can no longer be perceived by any outside observer
 -  (theorised) stretching of consciousness across all instances and points in time

If one finds themselves succumbing to the sickness within instance Δ-2 however, they will instead become a [[Void Roamer]].

Perception Sickness is temporarily reversed using Perception Pills, no known cure or long term treatment is as of yet known.

It is known that those who have been born in the Tanglements possess an immunity to the affliction, however this immunity decreases over the individuals lifetime. Typically at around 18 years old the individual will also start to experience minor symptoms of Perception Sickness.

The final stage of the sickness has given rise to the common phrase present in many of the writings and stories of the Tanglements' human inhabitants, a phrase intended to invoke both comfort and horror in its implications:

> "No one dies in the Tanglements, you just can't perceive them anymore."

## Units & Flora
Units are the name given to the animate fauna of the Tanglements. The name "Unit" was found in a [[Precursor]] text. Units come in three categories based on their power as an expression of how close they are to the code of the simulation:

 -  High Level - Furthest from the code, often similar to naturally evolved Fauna in the real world.
 -  Mid Level - An intermediary possessing a mixture of the capabilities of High and Low Level.
 -  Low Level - Closest to the code, often able to manipulate the simulation itself.
